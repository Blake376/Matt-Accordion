        category: "",
        body: "Findings In this longitudinal study of 65 adolescent females, we examined functional connectivity in limbic, salience, and executive control networks. High-risk adolescent females who were resilient to depression had greater connectivity between regions in limbic and executive control networks than did high-risk adolescent females who developed depression and low-risk control adolescents; further, the strength of this connectivity was correlated with positive life events in the group of resilient adolescent females.",
